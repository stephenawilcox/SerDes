# SerDes project

This project contains single-cycle serializer/deserializer that utilizes multiple memory banks to serialize/deserialize all the input/output data in one cycle.

It also contains multi-cycle serializer and deserializer modules for writing/reading to/from a single memory bank.

The memory modules used can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/stephenawilcox/memory).
